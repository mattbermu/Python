## 🧠 Fundamentals

The **fundamentals** folder contains small Python scripts created while learning core concepts.

### Topics Covered
- Variables and data types
- Arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators
- Conditional statements (`if / elif / else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- User input handling
- Lists, tuples, and string manipulation
- Built-in functions like `range()`
- Operator precedence

📁 Location: `fundamentals/`  
📄 Each file focuses on **one specific concept** for clarity and practice.

## 🚀 Projects

### 📝 Simple To-Do List App (Python)

A command-line To-Do List application that allows users to manage daily tasks with persistent storage.

**Features**
- View tasks
- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks
- Save tasks to a file (`tasks.txt`) so they persist between runs

**Technologies & Concepts Used**
- Python 3
- Functions
- Loops and conditionals
- File handling (`open`, read, write)
- User input validation
- Basic error handling (`try / except`)

📁 Location: `projects/simple_todo_app`
